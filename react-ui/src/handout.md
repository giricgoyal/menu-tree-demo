Our company wants to switch to data driven product development. To make this initiative work we need to design a reusable function capable of collecting and delivering UI analytics to the backend server.

To get you started we created a small snippet of code which should explain how we intend to use that API function.

```js
// This is the example of component to be instrumented using the function
class Component {
    constructor() {
        // this is where the unction could be called for example
        sendAnalyticsEvent(event)
        setTimeout(this.init, 100)
    }
    init() {
        sendAnalyticsEvent(event)
    }
}
```

Your goal is to implement the sendAnalyticsEvent(event) API function.

```js
const sendAnalyticsEvent = (event) => {
    // TODO: add your code here
    // example event
    // {
    // "type": "pageView",
    // "data": {
    //   "userId": "abc123"
    // }
}
```

Requirements:

1. Immediately send

When using an API, you would need to POST those analytics events down to the backend via some `/analytics` end-point. To get you started we’ve developed a simple mock of the server API abstraction.
Feel free to change this implementation.

```js
const doRequest = (events) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        return resolve({
            ok: true,
            status: 200,
            json: () => Promise.resolve({}),
        })
    })
}
```

Server returns 200 HTTP code and empty response when API worked fine.

Server returns 500 HTTP code and empty response when server has experienced an error.

```js
const doRequest = (event) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        return resolve({
            ok: false,
            status: 500,
            json: () => null,
        })
    })
}
```

200 -
300
400 -
500 - server fault
